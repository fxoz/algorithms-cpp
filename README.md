# `algorithms-cpp`

Various computer science algorithms from my
Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen /
Algorithms and data structures class.

**This is more like a mixed collection of stuff I've worked on than an actual,
focused program.**

⚠️ Because they're not copied from somewhere else (like ChatGPT),
they can (and likely will) **not** be optimal or work in every edge case.
Feel free to open a pull request or issue if you want to.

## You don't know how to utilize the functions/classes?

Simply use the history feature of Git/GitHub to view the source tree
back when the features/algorithm you wanted to try out were added
and check out the `main.cpp`.
